# Enemies
[Crumbling Golem] This golem starts out fairly large and crumbles as you do damage to it. 
		 Some types of golems might even break into 2 or even 3 separate golems.
		
[Blood Golem] These golems are tricky to fight because the longer it takes to defeat it, the stronger they get.
  
[Endurance Golem] An Endurance golem is a unique enemy in that technically you dont even have to fight them.
		This is because endurance golems will activate when an enemy approaches, and they will exhaust
		their energy supply after a certain amount of time, you just have to not die!
                      
[Little Cousin Imp] These little demons are tricky to deal with because as you fight them they have a chance
		to summon one of their bigger cousins which are quite a bit nastier.
		Not every imp you fight will summon a cousin but when they do, you better be prepared!
