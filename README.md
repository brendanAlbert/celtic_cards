#  Classes (the comma separated names are simply different possible names for the same class)
My version 0.1 of the classes is the following. I was thinking that the player chooses their class at the selection screen. Upon entering the game, you begin as a humble level 1 hero, no real abilities except for a basic attack.  Hit or poke enemy with your starting weapon.

  - Woad Warrior, Woad Raider, Woad Fighter, Woad Rager
  - Paladin, Knight of the Light, Holy Warrior
  - Sanguinmancer, Bloodmancer, Ichormancer, Aimamancer
  - Necromancer
  - Druid
  - Beastman, Master of Beasts, Beast Smith, Bestialary, Beastion, Hunter, Tracker, Ranger
  
# Spell Cards
  The way this game works, rather than collecting dropped weapons for use, as in a traditional action rpg, you use cards.

  Rather than having a spell tree that you choose from upon leveling, you earn your abilities through befriending the right people, defeating certain enemies, braving tough and challenging dungeons or completing quests.  Or perhaps you will be rewarded for exploring off the beaten path.
  
  It's not quite final how this will work but this is to get the creative juices flowing and perhaps to establish a skeleton upon which better more complete ideas may be attached.
  
  Lets walk through how the item process might work the first time playing through the game.
  
  You choose the ranger/bow class.  You start with a dagger and a bow card for weapons.  For weapons that require ammunition like a bow, you must also carry ammo in an ammo slot.
  
  So you fight your first monster. A zombie.  It has 3 health.  The bow is a ranged weapon and a zombie is a melee enemy, so the player naturally gets first chance to attack.  Lets say the bow does 1 damage, regardless of the type of ammo used, and the ammo itself adds an additional amount of damage. The starting arrows add an additional measly 1 damage.
  
  So the player makes the first move and shoots the zombie.  This is your ordinary slow shambling zombie and thus has no chance to dodge any attack.  In fact, they have no tactics to speak of, they simply shuffle towards you until they eat brains, or you put them down.
  
  Because you are a level 1 ranger, you simply aim for the zombies torso.  A nice clean hit to the chest.  The zombie has 1/3 health.  Because the zombie is far enough away, you get a second shot before it is even in range to hit you.  You fire again.
  
  The next arrow finds its mark in the zombie's undead heart.  Although a zombies heart does not really keep it alive, the shot does disturb the unholy magic keeping it alive in undeath.
  
  If the zombie had had a weapon, we would be able to pick it up and add it to our deck of cards.
  
  Arrows should have a chance to break and become unrecoverable.  Any arrows that survive can be collected.
  
  Let's say we decided to fight the zombie with our dagger. By attack with the dagger, we automatically close quarters with the zombie and now must fight toe-to-toe. No range advantage this time.  By choosing a melee weapon or ability, you lose that element of range.
  
  Lets say the dagger has a durability.  So after using the weapon a certain number of times, it would break.  Therefore, players have to collect the proper regeants necessary to keep that weapon usable. (This idea is assuredly open to change)

# Quest Ideas
  - Daughter goes missing in swamp, must find her.  There is an enemy type, the siren.  A demon that looks and sounds like a       human to attract hapless victims.  The idea is that after running into the trap of several sirens, you start to second guess   whether the girl you have stumbled upon is really the lost girl or simply another siren.
  - Out in one of the swamps are the ruins of a small and what was once upon a time, a noble kingdom.  Now the tower is abandoned and all signs of a once prosperous little kingdom, have vanished.  As of late however, folk have seen strange lights and noises coming from that part of the swamp.  Anyone who has ventured too close, never returned to inform the living of what they discovered... [this is one of those daily spawn wave quests. waves of undead will pour forth every day from this swamp keep until the source of undeath is put to rest.]
    
# Game Mechanics
  - A daily quest type scenario.  Every day the town you are in is invaded by a wave of enemies. You can cause the waves to cease by finding the monster or enemy somewhere out in the wilderness who is sending out these waves of enemies.  Every day that you don't go out and kill this special enemy , or accomplish whatever quest is spawning these waves of enemies, the waves will get increasingly more difficult.  So it beehooves you to accomplish it relatively quickly.
