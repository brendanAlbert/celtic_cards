# Bloodmancer
  - Bloodmancy.
  The bloodmancer would be perhaps similar to bloodseeker from Dota 2.
  There are several playstyles for the bloodmancer. Since I was thinking that talent trees have been done away with
  and class specialization comes from using certain cards in your deck / hand. Depending on how we decide to implement
  this mechanic. Since talent trees have been removed, you can choose to use melee fighter enchancement type cards 
  or you can play the blood mancer as more of a mage type class, but the spells used involve blood rituals.
  
# Cards/Abilities/Spells
  - [Sacrifice] On use, you sacrifice an amount of life to deal an increased amount of damage when you play this card.
  - [Smell Blood] You can smell wounds on the enemy. If you play this card when the enemy has already been wounded, 
     you deal increased damage because you know where to target where they are already injured.
  - [Mortal Ritual] The player slices open their own palm and uses the blood as a catalyst for a powerful damage spell.
  - [Fast Clotting] - The bloodmancer is a specialist in all things related to blood. To prevent himself from bleeding
    out, the blood mancer can call upon ancient techniques on how to clot the blood to reduce the amount of damage he
    takes.
  - [Lesser Blood Golem] - Upon reaching a certain level of proficiency in the art of sanguine magics, the bloodmancer can
    summon a golem made entirely of blood. A bloodmancer of novice level proficiency will only be able to summon a
    golem of modest potency.
      - [Minor Blood Golem]
      - [Blood Golem]
      - [Blood Golem Twins] - In this version of the spell, while neither golem is that powerful on its own, together
        they represent a threat not to be taken lightly.
      - [Major Blood Golem]
  - [Purified Veins] - The bloodmancer is able to eliminate all manner of harmful ailments and toxic substances that
    might have taken up residence within her circulatory system. Can drastically reduce duration of poisoning, or prevent
    it altogether.
