  # Aos Si.
    In Irish and Scottish legend, sidhe are these mounds that dot the landscape.
    The Aes or Aos Si / Aes Sidhe (there are many spelling depending on which
    celtic lore you are looking at) are the people of the mounds. In fact
    many of these sites are ancient burial grounds of the pre-celtic people
    of Ireland. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aos_S%C3%AD]
    My understanding is that fairies inhabit some of these mounds
    or they reside in certain trees, or lochs.  Im sure we can come up with some quests
    pertaining to these!
  
  # Missing Daughter.
    Daughter goes missing in swamp, must find her.  There is an enemy type, the siren.  
    A demon that looks and sounds like a human to attract hapless victims.
    The idea is that after running into the trap of several sirens, you start to second guess
    whether the girl you have stumbled upon is really the lost girl or simply another siren.
    
  # Undead Keep
    Out in one of the swamps are the ruins of a small and what was once upon a time, a noble kingdom.
    Now the tower is abandoned and all signs of a once prosperous little kingdom, have vanished.
    As of late however, folk have seen strange lights and noises coming from that part of the swamp.
    Anyone who has ventured too close, never returned to inform the living of what they discovered... 
    [this is one of those daily spawn wave quests. waves of undead will pour forth every day from this 
    swamp keep until the source of undeath is put to rest.]

  # Bandit Cavern
    If you travel far enough down the shore, there is a deep system of caverns where a group of bandits is hiding out.
    If you can fight your way to the bottom of the cavern and defeat the head boss and his minions,
    you will be rewarded handsomely.

  # Banshee
    One of the towns is being haunted by a restless banshee.  Every few nights she has been returning to the town,
    to kill one of its inhabitants.  You must find her hiding place and put an end to her reign of terror.  
    Similar to the spawn waves of enemies quests, she will not stop killing townsfolk until you find the place
    or object that is tethering her to the mortal realm.

  # Demon Hogger
    Poisoned crops. 
    Another hamlet that you visit is suffering because someone or something is poisoning the food-supply.

  # Werewolf.
    I imagine some kind of Transylvania type area and town which protects a mountain pass.  You must travel through
    this mountain pass to reach the next area, but the person in charge of the caravan wont risk the lives of his horses and
    the goods in his caravan until you bring back proof of that the werewolf stalking the woods has been dealt with.

  # Spider Mine.
    In the mountain village there is a blacksmith, famous across the realm for the weapons she creates.  The weapons
    are so sought after because they are made from a special metal from a nearby mine.  She has not been able to practice her
    craft as of late because the mine that supplies the ore is home to some new residents.  Deadly spiders.  In fact, the
    queen spider deep in the mine is so prolific in her egg-laying that every day spiders pour forth to attack the village.
    If you slay the massive arachnid, the villagers will be able to return to harvest the ore and the blacksmith can make
    you a fabulous weapon for your troubles.
