# Quest Ideas
  - Daughter goes missing in swamp, must find her.  There is an enemy type, the siren.  
    A demon that looks and sounds like a human to attract hapless victims.
    The idea is that after running into the trap of several sirens, you start to second guess
    whether the girl you have stumbled upon is really the lost girl or simply another siren.
  - Out in one of the swamps are the ruins of a small and what was once upon a time, a noble kingdom.
    Now the tower is abandoned and all signs of a once prosperous little kingdom, have vanished.
    As of late however, folk have seen strange lights and noises coming from that part of the swamp.
    Anyone who has ventured too close, never returned to inform the living of what they discovered... 
    [this is one of those daily spawn wave quests. waves of undead will pour forth every day from this 
    swamp keep until the source of undeath is put to rest.]
