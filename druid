  # Healing Spells
    - [Crude Heal] Utilizing a crude form of druid magic, the druid can heal a target or self 
      but at the cost of health from another source. This means that, you would have to draw on a summoned creature
      or ally to use this spell.
    - [Lesser Nature's Touch] Although the healing from this spell is not substantial, it does have the benefit of
      requiring only mana/reagents to use.
    - [Nature's Touch]
    - [Power Nature's Touch] This is the kind of healing that takes Druids many years to become proficient at. Do not expect
      to start using heals like this until you have progressed relatively far in your adventure.
  
  # Defensive Spells
    - [Briar shield] The Druid can fashion a crude natural shield made of interwoven briar thorns. Although not the
      toughest of materials, it will do in a pinch.
    - [Briar armor] Protecting herself in a protective layer of thorns and various stabbing plants, the druid gains
      increased resistance to damage, and at later levels, this spell will even reflect damage at an attacker.
  
  # Offensive Spells
    - [Summon Creeper] The Druid can animate plants to do his bidding. The Druid finds a suitable plant to cast this
      spell, the plant will crawl out of the ground and walk on its root. Depending on the Druids skill and the strength of
      the plant, the plant can have various abilities and methods of fighting. Several abilities might be: a plant that
      shoots darts at enemies, a tanky cactus-like plant that serves as a tank and reflects damage, vine creepers might 
      entangle a single enemy of perhaps various enemies, rooting them in place.  Some plants might have fast-acting or perhaps
      slow-acting poisons, depending on the Druid's needs.
